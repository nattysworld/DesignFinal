Too often, we miss out on events or our plans fall through due to disorganized communication. With busy schedules, keeping track of plans over text can be challenging, and coordinating everyone's availability for an event can feel like a puzzle. Many users complain about text being too difficult to use as a sole platform for planning and mention they would like to see a more efficient way to plan, especially visually. ","targetRectangle":{"y":245.69680788739447,"x":207.76446566845857,"width":1495.443359375,"height":186}},{"text":"Circles is designed to streamline the planning process to crystallize intentions into concrete details, so that events transcend mere discussion. Whether it’s an official event you’ve heard about or seen online, or one you want to create, the app is aimed to make it easier to share these with your friends. With calendar polling and voting systems, availability and preferences can align more easily when suggesting plans. Users can post their own plans, or add events from the explore page, and add it to their groups (circles). Other members can add their feedback, all while having a “best day to meet” set with the help of the app. Especially when groups are large, the app easily points to dates rather than relying on word of mouth. Drawing from personal experiences and widespread feedback, Circles embodies a solution to the perennial struggle of making plans, making socializing more convenient and fulfilling for everyone involved.","targetRectangle":{"y":462.69680788739447,"x":207.76446566845857,"width":1512.24609375,"height":341}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.00035007912466775983,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"399B39C6D66C172D4A15EC8EF9BD4314"}]}]}}]}
